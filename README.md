<h1>Experience API</h1>
<h3>
    This is an <a href="https://work-experience-65773cac05ee.herokuapp.com/"> Work Experience API </a> built using JavaScript and deployed using Heroku. <br /> <br />

    I wanted to create this API to hold my experience, which I can then
    call upon when creating my Portfolio website. <br /> <br />

    This exercise also helped me understand at a basic level, how API's are created and
    deployed. I am able to use GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, OPTIONS and DELETE commands on my 
    API <a href="https://work-experience-65773cac05ee.herokuapp.com/"> found here </a>
